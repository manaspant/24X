# 24X
Made this in 24 hours

24X is an event where 10 students from diverse disciplines come together for 24 hours to create something new. Participants will collaborate with an assigned partner on an original project of their choice - a game, a performance, a poem, a sculpture, a mobile app - itâ€™s up to the team and their imaginations to decide!

At the outset of the event, a theme is revealed to inspire the work. Each pair will have 24 hours to come up with an idea, prototype it, and present their project to the NYUAD community. Teams will share their process and reflections on the experience. Faculty and staff mentors will be on hand throughout to provide support.
This year's theme was 'Reimagining time'.
